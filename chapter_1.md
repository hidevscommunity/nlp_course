**Chapter 1 - Introduction to NLP**

****

**1.1 What is Natural Language Processing(NLP)**

****

Ever wondered about the technology/science behind many advanced applications that we see/use 

in our day-to-day life. 

For example, apart from standard English, Google asks you to display the search results in the popular regional language based on your location.

Here, As you can see the search query is also translated into Hindi by Google, while displaying the results.

****

Similarly, many other progressive applications that we use - 

- **Personal assistants**: Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa etc.

- **Machine translations**: Google translate, Microsoft translator

- **Auto-completion & auto-correction**: In search engines, in smart document editors etc.

- **Gmail’s auto-reply**

- **Chatbots(Conversation** **Systems)** integrated into various applications for support and common queries, complaints, product enquiry, online shopping, placing orders, etc. 

****

All the above(or any similar) applications use the **Natural Language Processing(NLP)** technique directly or indirectly. Now, what is this NLP?

****

Natural Language Processing(NLP) is a subset of artificial intelligence that covers the interactions between computers and natural human languages(e.g. Standard English). NLP majorly deals with text and speech data(the most common way to express ideas and feelings in natural languages).

****

NLP provides the ability to read, analyze, understand and derive meanings from natural languages to the machines. NLP relies on machine learning and deep learning techniques in order to derive meanings/insights from the natural languages.

**1.2 NLP Applications**

****

NLP has always got the attention and momentum right from its inception. NLP has numerous applications in various sectors. To acknowledge its power and impact, let’s see some prominent applications of NLP.

****

**1. Sentiment Analysis / Social media monitoring** 

In today’s world people often use social media to post their thoughts/feedback about a particular product, service, policy, campaign, person, group etc. 

****

Analyzing such posts and their sentiments helps companies to understand their customers better, the problems/issues they are fixing, areas of improvement, their responsiveness etc.

****

**2. Email filters** 

Identifying spam emails and filtering them to a separate section prevents unnecessary congestion of our primary inbox. 

****

Using NLP, the words or phrases (in the subject line or in the email body) that indicate a spam signal are identified. Similarly, like Gmail, mails can be classified into sections like “primary”, “social”, and “promotions” as soon as the mail arrives.

****

**3. Text Summarization** 

As the name suggests, text summarization is a technique to generate a meaningful summary of the text from resources like news articles, blogs, books etc. It not only saves the reader’s time but also helps in getting the most important and relevant information very quickly. 

****

Using advanced NLP and deep learning techniques, text summarization can be done. The best example of text summarization is **Inshorts**, a mobile app that converts news articles into 60 words summary.

****

**4. Text Categorization**

Since news/blogs on an event/topic are available from multiple sources and authors, so this database keeps on expanding. 

****

Classifying news articles into one of the predefined classes like “Sports”, “Business”, “Politics”, “Technology”, “Entertainment” etc. helps in organizing the news articles and maintaining the database.

****

**5. Question-Answering System** 

Making a user-friendly Question-Answering(QA) system can help in getting useful information efficiently. 

****

Using NLP, we can make a QA system that provides the right answer to the questions rather than just providing a list of possible answers. Such systems make the searching process more powerful and engage the users better.

****

**6. A chatbot (Virtual Assistants)** 

Initially chatbots were adopted to avoid tedious and frustrating waiting time to connect to a customer care representative. But today they have evolved much to solve basic to advanced level customer queries. 

****

Even some intelligent chatbots offer personalized assistance to their customers. Today, many companies use such assistants on their multiple platforms like websites, apps etc.

****

**7. Auto-suggestion and Auto-correction** 

Using NLP, we can translate pieces of text from one language to another (even NLP helps you in typing faster and accurately while composing any email, blog post or any other document by making use of auto-suggestion and auto-correction. 

****

Similarly, google provides a better search experience by auto-completing and auto-correcting your search query. For documentation, tools like Grammarly, and Google docs help in writing better by correcting the grammar, and spelling mistakes and suggesting better alternatives.

****

**8. Language translation**

Communicating to another person in his natural language without having any prior knowledge of that language is pretty helpful and amazing, right? 

****

many). For e.g., Google translate understands more than 100 languages. Such translators help people and businesses to break the language barrier.
